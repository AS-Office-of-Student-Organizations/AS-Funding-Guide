# Project Goals

1) An improvement to the funding guide displayed at [https://finance.ucsd.edu/Home/FundingGuide](finance.ucsd.edu) with **clarity** and **usability** at the forefront of the design
2) Features to edit and change this funding guide for future AVPs
3) Applications of machine learning (or API calls to current existing LLMs) for personal career goals
4) Display & insights integrations with data collected from the A.S Attendance Verification Form

## Further Details
While I have authority to make edits to the official funding guide, I cannot get rid of usually-unnecessary but situationally relevant information as it must be a "legal document". I'd like to address that by having
an "unofficial" but relevant and useful site that can serve the needs of student organizations & the AVP office.

## Some Feature Brainstorm

* Funding Guide Display
  1) Display relevant points of A.S funding guide in a concise manner, linking explanations for caveats (MVP)
  2) FAQ page (Extension 1)
  3) RAG with funding guide + other specific training materials for complex queries from student orgs (Extension 2)

* Event Planning
  1) Basic event planning checklist with flowchart style logic (MVP)
  2) Dashboard for any student organization planning events, with instructions for end-to-end planning including Room Reservations, A.S funding, TAP (Triton Activity Planner), and other campus resources (Extension 1)
  3) Login & shared resources for each student organization, integrated with CSI database & UCSD SSO (Extension 2)
 
* Data display & insights from A.S attendance form
  1) Summary statistics from the A.S attendance form displayed on charts, including recent trends, outliers, and financial numbers. Posted manually (MVP)
  2) Summary statistics automatically generated from live feed from A.S attendance form, PEEFs, List Funded, etc. (Extension 1)
  3) Personalized statistics for each organization generated from live event feed (Extension 2)
